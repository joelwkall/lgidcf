TODO:

* [ ] More events for weapons (timed, player collision)
* [ ] Multiple weapons
* [ ] Life bars / jetpack fuel bars
* [ ] Scorekeeping
* [ ] Fullscreen
* [X] Deployment on computers without Rust installed (works with MSVC++ redist on windows)
* [ ] Sound effects
* [ ] Weapon builder
* [ ] Performance tuning
* [ ] Menus and stuff
* [ ] Background image
* [ ] Obstacles
* [ ] Player names

Design decisions:
- Jetpack as a device instead?
- Large map with zoom in on players?
